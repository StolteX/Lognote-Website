                    <h3>Last updated on 12.04.2024</h3>

                <p>Reflectly ApS ('we' or 'us' or 'our') respects the privacy of our users ('user' or 'you'). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our mobile application Lognote (the 'App')
                    or our website <a href="https://lognote.netlify.app">Lognote.app</a> (collectively, the 'Site').
                </p>
                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the 'Last updated' date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this
                    Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the App after the
                    date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
                </p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the App or make payments, including any in-game virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any
                    of the data collected by any such third party.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information
                    that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect,
                    use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our Site.
                </p>
                <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APP.</p>
                <h4>What personal information do we collect from the people who use our app?</h4>
                <p>Your email address is collected if you send an email to our <a title="stoltex.solutions@gmail.com" href="mailto:stoltex.solutions@gmail.com">support email</a>.</p>
                <h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
                <p>We may use the information we collect from you in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To improve our website or application in order to better serve you.</li>
                    <li>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
                    <li>To follow up a application bug or crash investigation.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Third-party disclosure</h4>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information or other Personal Information entered into our app.
                </p>
                <h4>Third-party links</h4>
                <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our Site. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content
                    and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
                <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a Privacy Policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                    the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous Privacy Policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
                    companies with whom it is being shared. You can read more <a title="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p><strong>In accordance with CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong></p>
                <p>Users can visit our Site anonymously.</p>
                <p>Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
                </p>
                <p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy page.</p>
                <p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong></p>
                <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
                <p><strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>
                <p>It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
                <h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
                <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
                    agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
                <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
                <h4>Amendments to Privacy Policy</h4>
                <p>We have the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice to each User. Any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy in the future will be posted here. Where appropriate, we will notify you or seek your consent.
                    Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h4>Contact info</h4>
                <p>If at any time you would like to contact us with your views about our privacy practices, or with any inquiry relating to your Personal Data (its correction, removal or use), you can do so by sending a message to our <a title="stoltex.solutions@gmail.com"
